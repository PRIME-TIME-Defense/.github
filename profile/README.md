### Project Description
**Prime Time Defense, a leading cybersecurity firm, is tasked with conducting a threat emulation engagement for SimCorp, a major financial services company. As part of the engagement, Prime Time Defense's blue team, known as "Prime Time Defense," will adopt a proactive threat hunter posture. They'll observe and document adversarial progress in SimCorp's Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) without interfering, treating it as a honeypot. Their challenge is to quickly identify and address any blind spots in detection capabilities to ensure no threats are overlooked. With time ticking, Prime Time Defense must swiftly bolster detection mechanisms while maintaining engagement integrity. Strategic collaboration is key in safeguarding SimCorp's systems from cyber threats.**
